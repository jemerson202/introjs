## Introduction to JavaScript Exercises

These are test driven development oriented exercises from the
[Introduction to JavaScript and Web Development](http://montanacodeschool.com/other-courses/intro-to-javascript-web-development-26501983145/) two day class
offered by [Montana Code School](http://montanacodeschool.com).

The first is from the [Fizz Buzz drinking game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz), where multiples of 3 are converted to 'Fizz', multiples of 5 to 'Buzz', and
multiples of 3 and 5 are converted to 'FizzBuzz'. You need to add to the
implementation in fizzBuzz.js. And change the "xit" tests to "it" to activate them in
fizzBuzzTest.js.

The second is a converter of Roman Numerals into regular JavaScript
integers. You need to add to the implementation in romanNumeralConverter.js,
change the "xit" tests to "it" to activate them in romanNumeralConverterTest.js.
You can add more tests for more roman number examples.

The third is the beginning of a TicTacToe game.

To start, you need to install Node.js
Then run 'npm install' in the project root directory to get mocha and chai.

Tests should be run with 'npm test'.

## Learning Resources

There are many online learning platforms, many of which cost money. We highly recommend these
two free resources to support your learning.
* [Exercism - TDD oriented exercises in many languages](http://exercism.io/)
* [FreeCodeCamp.org - methodical exercises for programming](http://freecodecamp.org)
* [JavaScript Koans](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans)
Perhaps the best way to keep learning is to support each other and learn together. FreeCodeCamp
encourages local groups to self-organize, as did a group in Missoula:
* [FreeCodeCamp Missoula on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.missoula)
We highly recommend you also join the Montana-Programmer's on Meetup.com. You can attend
presentations and networking events. Consider also posting your own learning events. One of the
best ways to learn something is to teach it.
* [Montana-Programmers on Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Montana-Programmers)
Though the teachers of the class have not found these books to
be especially helpful to them personally, some have found these JavaScript books useful.
* [JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742)
* [JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-JQuery-Interactive-Front-End-Development/dp/1118531647)
And here is a book about Mob Programming.
